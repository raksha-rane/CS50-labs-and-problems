#### Description:
TS-13 is a website that allows people to know in depth about Taylor Swift’s music. The
homepage consists of the Lover House which resembles all her albums through each window.
In the center, there is a styled form that allows the user to sign up using his/her details like Name,
number, email and password. It also has a checkbox for agreeing with terms and conditions
before signing up. It has a button to sign up which changes colour when hovering and when
active.

On the top, there’s a blue “Click here!” button that is basically a reference to a prompt box using
JavaScript. On clicking that button, it turns green when hovered. The prompt asks the user to
type his/her name and submit. Then the webpage greets the user using his name/ Like for
example, if you enter “Raksha”, the webpage will display the text “Hello Raksha! Welcome to
TS-13, it’s been waiting for you.” The page has a footer that displays my name, as a developer
of it.

On the top navigation bar, there is logo of my website. On clicking that logo, the user is directed
to Taylor Swift’s official website. Next to it is dropdown menu of Albums and then Merch too.
The last menu is Tour.

Within the Albums dropdown, the list displays the titles of her albums and changes colour
when hovered. Same with Merch. I used Bootstrap to create this nav bar.
For each album, there is a separate dedicated webpage that opens in new tab.
1. Red (Taylor’s Version)
2. Lover
3. Folklore
4. Evermore
5. Midnights

Each of these webpages have a big header that is the logo of that album. They all have
respective background images that suit the aesthetic and vibe of that album. Over the
background image is the foreword division in the center. Foreword contains the text that describes the motivation,
idea and overall aesthetic of the album. It is written by Taylor Swift and directly addressed to
her fans and listeners. Furthermore, there are music videos of respective albums displayed in a
grid below the foreword, under the heading “Music Videos”. I used the poster property to set
the thumbnail of every video. There is a nav bar on top that has “Back” and “Lyrics” options.

The Back option redirects user back to the homepage (index.html). The lyrics page displays the
lyrics of all songs of that album in exact sequence.
Within the Merch dropdown menu, there are all album merchandise that directs user to official
store of that particular album.
Lastly, the Tour option on nav bar directs the user to the official concert/events booking page
of Taylor Swift.
